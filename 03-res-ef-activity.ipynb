    "\n",
    "Jupyter is one of many execution environments for Python.  Its specific vision of the world is that work is done iteratively, with an active session. There are two main types of Python environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Script-like\" execution means that you write down all the code in a file, and that entire file is run in order. \n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Interpreter-like\" execution means that you type in commands one at a time. The session pauses after each, waiting for the next command. This is really similar to how the command line is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a hybrid of both those things.  Notebooks are composed of cells.  Then the cells are executed like mini scripts.  This gives you the advantage of keeping the session alive so you don't have to repeat loading data, etc., and the advantage of being able to execute multiple lines of code at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is powerful, but there are a few traps. Let's get comfortable with cells first. Try running this code cell by either pressing ```Shift``` + ```Enter``` or clicking on the \"Run\" icon in the toolbar below the Jupyter menus:"

Python will not interpret the characters after the ```#``` as executable code, but instead as plain text. Comments are used to help contextualize and document choices that are made in code, as well as provide metadata and information about the code and its provenance. For instance, it is common to see informal citations in code comments, as well as text explaining possible limitations or variances of code. It is generally considered a best practice to add comments to (sometimes referred to as \"comment out\") code, especially with an eye to optimizing its utility for others. To add a comment in Python, you can simply type ```#``` and then your comment afterwards, or you can convert code into a comment by highlighting a selection of words with your mouse, and then pressing ```Command``` + ```/```."

Here are some tips for overcoming them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter allows you to evaluate cells out of order, but you should only do them in order--top to bottom.\n",
    "* In Python, we must import libraries (code that we or others have written for people to use) that we want to use in our notebook. We do this using import statements with the syntax ```import <library name>```. Running cells out of order can cause you to skip import statements, which will cause errors when running code that uses the library before Python has been told to import it.\n",
    "* If you are getting errors that make no sense, sometimes going back to the top and starting over fixes it.\n",

    "As before, the data is returned as a Pandas DataFrame. This time, there is much more information. The columns in bold are an index.

This row says that for the 24th page, in the body section (i.e. ignoring any words in the header or footer), the word 'years' occurs 1 time as an plural noun. The part-of-speech tag for a plural noun, NNS, follows the Penn Treebank definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the DataFrame returned by `vol.tokenlist()`, page, section, token, and POS were part of the index (try the command `tl.index.names` to confirm). One can think of an index as the margin content of an Excel spreadsheet: the letters along the top and numbers along the left side are the indices. A cell can be referred to as A1, A2, B1... In Pandas, however, you can name these, so instead of A, B, C, or 1,2,3, columns and rows can be referred to by more descriptive names. You can also have multiple levels, so you're not bound by the two-dimensions of a table format. With a multi-indexed DataFrame, you can ask for `Page=24,section=Body, ...`.  One can think of an index as the margin notations in Excel (i.e. 1,2,3... and A,B,C,..), except it can be named and can have multiple levels.\n",
